# Peer Review: Trent Rueckert

## Clarity and Organization
- The notebook is very well structured and easy to follow

## Feature Selection and Justification
- I think the feature selection was good; however, it didn't really gather many insights on which features might produce a better outcome for the banknotes 

## Model Performance and Comparisons
- The model performed very very well. That would make sense since the X variable included all of the features (except for class)

## Reflection Quality
- The finding of duplicate rows was really well done. I did not include that in my original cleaning of the data so I need to make sure I do that in my own projects in the future. I found that their findings were extremely well done.
